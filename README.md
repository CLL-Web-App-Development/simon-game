# simon-game
This is a web implementation of Simon Game to exercise and improve upon your memory capacity with pattern recognition. Has been done as part of an online web-development course project, taught by *Dr. Angela Yu*.

* How does the game work ?

At each level a single random button from the four buttons (*green, red, yellow or blue*) will be highlighted. As the player, you will have to remember the sequence of highlighted buttons from *level-1* to the *current-level* you are at. Even though at each level only one sequence will be highlighted by the game control, you should enter the entire sequence from the very first level. So, the sequence would keep getting longer with each level and would effectively be a test for your memory and also your ability to strategize a mapping for longer sequences, that can enable their retainment in your memory.
